Little C++ SQLite wrapper.

SQLiteDB is a creatively named minimal C++ wrapper for SQLite. All of the other ones I found were too big and carried too much baggage. This uses nothing but standard libs and hides nothing from you - you're free to get the connection and do whatever to it directly. I tend to prefer lowest common denom C conventions on generic things like this (for example taking a const char* instead of a std::string on execute) and as such there's very little hand holding. Feel free to improve however you want, it's public domain.

TODO: C++11 begin / end iterator support on cursor. Meh.
